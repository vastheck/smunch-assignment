# Smunch Assignment by Daniel Varga

I have decided to complete this assignment in the recommended stack using RemixJS which also comes with an Express based backend. I have used the indie stack with an SQLite database.

It has the the following user stories implemented:

    1. As a user I can see the restaurants and their available products, each with the latest
    review and the average rating, if they exist.
    2. As a user I can rate and leave reviews for each restaurant and product.
    3. As a user I can filter restaurants based on cuisine.

The app is deployed using Fly.io to URL:
